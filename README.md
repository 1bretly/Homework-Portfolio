Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Hello,

For this assignment we were required to created a portfolio. One that met the following requirements: fuction navagation bar, deployabe links for each of our projects, responsive layout for multiple media types, and more. I tried to create a page that was not only colorful but easy on the eyes.

Here is a picture of my portfolio!
